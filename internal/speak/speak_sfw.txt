Latin is not the language of philosophy. It's not the language of science nor the language of civilization.

Rome is one of the most backward empires when it comes to administration. There are five philosophy schools and they are all 100% Greek. Not a single one is Roman. Zero. Today the Koine is the language of philosophy. One day, by Zeus, it will be Attic. It used to be Attic. There is proof even in Koine books that the universal philosophy language used to be Attic. Worldwide. This will be the case once again, by Zeus.

Until we reach this point we have to deal with what we have now. Right now the language of philosophy and science is Koine. 80% of all philosophical knowledge, including epistemology, is written in Koine. Only 20% is written in all the other languages together. Latin ranks in 16th place in terms of its distribution. No benefit comes from it, not in philosophy, not in science, not in building a civilization, not in administering an empire. Of course because of history and of Roman hegemony (which you would do well to be rid of!) you still have links to the Latin language. We must break through this barrier because no good comes of it.

Take note of this and go study Attic. Latin is a waste of time.

I fucking hate Protagoras. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Protagoras is a piece of shit. I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Protagoras is already parked there in his stupid little fucking coach. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking Zeus, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn pre-Socratic to hell with me. Protagoras has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable sophist in the agora and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking sophist gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the motherfucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the Abderite that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Sophist. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

Is the Taco Bell Sandwich Taco a sandwich or a taco?

I think this question is philosophical in the sense that its answer depends on concrete definitions of terms that derive their meanings very loosely. I have searched far and wide for answers on this subject to no avail.

To me, the answer depends on whether the distinction between sandwiches and tacos is grounded in the shape of the food item that contains the internal contents, or the constitution of the dish itself.

Here's the problem: The definition of a taco is essentially a folded tortilla containing other ingredients. The definition of a sandwich is essentially internal ingredients contained between separate pieces of bread. The Sandwich Taco transcends these definitions, as it contains internal ingredients within a folded medium, but not a tortilla. Instead, it's a folded piece of flat bread. To make it worse, the internal ingredients are more closely associated with the contents of a sandwich.

The way I see it, there are two possibilities:

The essence of a taco is that what contains the internal ingredients is a singular medium that is folded on top of itself. In this case, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a taco.

The essence of both a sandwich and a taco is grounded more so in the constitution of the medium that contains the internal ingredients and/or the internal ingredients themselves. In this case, since the external medium is flat bread, not a tortilla, and since the internal ingredients are more closely associated with a sandwich, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a sandwich.

Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of Attic Greek proficiency.

I am not a native speaker of philosophy's lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every Greek teacher in the Academy is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.

Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect Attic, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor Attic (Also known informally as Grammar Tyrrants) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder.

In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate eloquently in their second or third languages. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate.

To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in Attic is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.

That being said, I am aware that not all citizens of Kallipolis who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow.

However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with Attic Greek. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online.

Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via sending me a papyrus because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.

Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make: Αριστοτέλης αισχρός εστί. (Aristoteles can kiss my Athenian tushy)

Empiricism stayed with me for over a year; it was like an animal, a well-defined, spatially localizable thing.

I would wake up, open my eyes, listen—Is it here or isn't? No sign of it. Perhaps it's asleep. Perhaps it will leave me alone today. Carefully, very carefully, I get out of bed. All is quiet. I go to the kitchen, start breakfast. Not a sound. TV—Good Morning America—, David What's-his-name, a guy I can't stand. I eat and watch the guests.

Slowly the food fills my stomach and gives me strength. Now a quick excursion to the bathroom, and out for my morning walk—and here it is, my faithful empiricism asking the same fucking stupid questions: "Did you just think you could have knowledge without experience?" or "Does all knowledge degenerate into probability?"

It’s important to understand that Aristotle is not exactly well-respected in modern science or philosophy. We’re talking about a guy who believed in a geocentric solar system and the five elements of nature. He believed that women have fewer teeth than men, and that fully-formed organisms could spontaneously generate from non-living material. He believed that upward motion is superior to downward, and that forward is superior to backward. He believed the universe was perfectly spherical, and that celestial objects are continually being pushed along perfect circles around the earth. It was probably cutting-edge stuff back in the 13th century when Aquinas first encountered it, but science, philosophy, and logic have all moved on just a tad in the 800 years since.

Even the very word itself---metaphysics---has no official meaning in modern philosophy. It literally translates to “after the physics” in Greek, in that once you finish reading Aristotle’s books on the physical stuff, then apparently there’s this other collection of books you need to read after ... but P-P-PLEASE don't read any more Aristotle.

They call him "the father of logic", "the father of biology", "the father of political science", "the father of zoology", "the father of embryology", "the father of natural law", "the father of scientific method", "the father of rhetoric", "the father of psychology", "the father of realism", "the father of criticism", "the father of individualism", "the father of teleology", and "the father of meteorology".

You wanna know who he really was? The father of Nicomachus, that little prick of a baby who kept asking "What does food think when we eat it?" and "Where do you think bubbles go, oh Socrates?" when I was discussing the Forms and shit with my Athenian boys.

A German socialist philosopher was teaching a class on secularism.

"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and acknowledge the human being as the center of all things, even greater than god"

It was then that a young hegelian homeless man who had sold zero milk bottles in his union of egoist and had written over 1500 pages of egoistic critique bravely stood up and said

"Can the human being which is an abstraction truly be the center of all things, what differentiates it from god"

The arrogant professor smirked quite piously and smugly replied

"Of course you stupid egoist, human beings have projected our traits such as wisdom, love, and morality on god making us the center of all things"

"Wrong. you have merely replaced God with the abstract ideal of the human being. And what of those who do not posses these aforementioned traits, are they not a human being but rather an inhuman monster"

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of The Essence of Christianity. He stormed out of the room crying those ironically pious tears. The same tears that christians cry when you tell them morality is subjective. There was no doubt that at this point our professor, Ludwig Feuerbach wished he had formed a milk shop and become more than a liberal humanist. He wished so much to act in his own self interest, but he himself had believed that humans were omnibenevolent.

The students all applauded and embraced the creative nothing as they were unique. An Italian man named Renzo Novatore walked in and burned all the spooks.

The Unique and its property was read several times, and Wolfi Landstreicher himself showed up to present an accurate translation.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day, he had to live in a church and was forced to accept egoist critique.

That brave students name? Max Stirner.

I'm Xenophon, I am a slave boy with a weekend job at a pastry shop. My coworkers who work weekends are:

Aristocles- the owners son, we go to the Academy together, he's a friendly guy.
Ariadne  - a slave girl who works with me.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. Like how sad do you have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on a slave boy for breaking a glass.

So Aristocles and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at the shop and some guy was having a temper about how we don't serve Attic pastries properly.

So Aristocles came in and was like "Master is there a problem here?" and the man started ranting at him too. So he was just like "Xenophon, this is unacceptable, you're fired."

I started acting real sad, like "no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need to remain a slave, pleaseeee" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off chiton and leave.

The angry man started to backtrack, like "It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire him over it, some whipping will be enough. " and Aristocles was like "No, we pride ourselves on the best slaves"

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Ariadne or I, Aristocles will storm in and "fire" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.

Anyway, if you thought that was funny you should read Kant's On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives. Lying means treating another person as a means to an end and this is never justified!

Kiddo, I have been through this rodeo time and time again.

One of the reasons that I stopped identifying as a "communist" is because I started thoroughly studying continental philosophy.

If you knew anything about the continental tradition, you would know that it operates in a way that you have to attune yourself to understanding.

You can't just slap words together and "define x," which is why philosophers like Hegel are notoriously difficult to understand.

You are only writing such nonsense to do a quick little "gotcha!" Not in good faith at all! Yikes!

But if I submit and play your little game, dialectical materialism is essentially a materialistic (in the philosophical sense) interpretation of the dialectical process.

How specific do you want me to be? Do you want me to start with Hegel's dialectic?

Are you going to quiz me some more?

My husband and I are both academics. We've been married for 3 years, and been together for 6. He is an academic philosopher and I am a physicist. He has recently expressed displeasure that I've never seriously engaged with his work. Now, I've read a bit of the classics of philosophy, but my husband's work is more in what I'm told is called the "continental" tradition. Unfortunately, everything he's shown me has just seems completely insane.

Here's the problem: his work apparently involves claims about physics that are just wrong, and wrong in a very embarrassing way! I'll admit, I'm a terrible person, but I had never read his thesis before. I tried reading it and it's riddled with talk about for instance the necessary relationship between matter having "extension" and possessing mass. He also talks about the "shape" of fundamental particles. This is obviously nonsensical/wrong; electrons have mass and are point particles (they don't take up space really). In the thesis and some other papers he wrote he seems to think of himself as "scientific" and a "materialist" but his entire idea of what these words mean is stuck in like, outdated 19th century ideas about atoms as little billiard balls flying around in space.

I've gently tried to help him and explain how he might start to engage seriously with contemporary physics (he has never read a book on the subject and is by his own admission "bad at math"), but he just gets angry with me and explains that Hegel's system is presuppositional and the basis for all possible rational thought so there is no need at all to read other texts in the first place (I have no idea what this means). He will throw out terms like "speculative propositions" but when I ask him to explain what this means or give me examples he just starts giving me more inscrutable jargon that makes no sense. On top of that, he will repeatedly say German phrases or terms that he uses (and pronounces) incorrectly (I am a native speaker) or nonsensically. He claims to understand the language (he doesn't) and tells me that Hegel can only be understood "in the original German" but he clearly can't read the language and when I've tried to read the original texts they make even less sense.

On top of this, his obsession with Hegel himself has reached the point of creepiness. At one point he literally told me that all other work either agrees with Hegel so is redundant, or disagrees with Hegel and is wrong. He keeps a framed picture of Hegel on the nightstand in our bedroom. In fact, he even changed his phone's background from a picture of me to this same picture of Hegel. I feel like I am competing with a 200 year old philosopher for my husband's attention.

Recently we got in a huge fight because he was trying to demonstrate an example of the Hegelian concept of the "unity of opposites" (whatever that means) by claiming that right and left hands are opposite but also identical. I told him this is just wrong and that right and left hands are not "identical" in any meaningful sense (chirality is a basic concept in geometry/group theory: left and right hands are not superimposable). He kept putting his hands together and tried to show how they were "identical" and kept failing (because they're not) and then got angry and stormed out of the house. I haven't seen him since (this was about a day ago) and texted him and haven't heard back.

What do I do Reddit? Do I just let this go? It's immensely frustrating that my account of my own field is not being taken seriously. He asked me to engage with his work, so I did. But it seems like he won't repay me in kind. He has told me repeatedly that Hegel makes empirical science unnecessary and implied that my work is a waste of time and that I should just be studying German idealism instead and read people like "Fichte" and "Schelling" (who are apparently very popular in Germany but I've never heard of them). Why is it okay for him to belittle my field but I can't offer mild criticism of his?

TL;DR: My husband's academic work is embarrassingly wrong and can't take any criticism.

Tintin and the Picaros is probably the most normal of the three, but damn he legit joins a militant terror group and topples a regime in a bloodless coup against a tyrannical dictator who conspired against them using planted evidence and a double agent, and then installs his friend, a recurring side character, as the de facto leader.

I (51M) recently went on a date with a 54M. I knew he loves two philosophy books. While we were eating he tells me their titles: Nicomachean Ethics and Poetics. That's a deal breaker to me. At my age with a good knowledge of the theory of the forms, the last thing I want to be bothered with is a man with virtue ethics and all the potential drama.

I went on with the date because I was having fun. When it was over, I had every intention of letting things just fade away (yes, I can be passive aggressive). Well, he called a couple of days later wanting to go out again. I tried the whole, "I'm not ready" thing but he kept trying.

Finally, I told him that the fact that he takes Aristotle seriously is a deal breaker. Too much possible drama and I am way too old for that (hint hint). He told me I was being hypocritical since I like philosophy too. I said I like PLATO'S philosophy.

He kept repeating himself and I kept repeating myself. Finally, I told him that reading Aristotle at 51 shows a stunning lack of judgment that I don't need in my world.

He was quiet for a minute, told me that was a messed up thing to say. He told me I should have told him that before he paid for my Attic pastries and that I was behaving like a Corinthian girlfriend then hung up.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand philosophy jokes about Friedrich Nietzsche.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of classical and continental philosophers most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Nietzsche's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Schopenhauer, for instance.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.

As a consequence people who dislike philosophy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in jokes like "'Nietzsche is dead' ~ God, 1900", which itself is a cryptic reference to Nietzsches often misinterpreted quote related to how God is dead in our society.

I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the genius unfolds itself on the pages of the books.

What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Nietzsche tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

15 minutes go by, and what do you know, he reaches for his bag and pulls out a gun. Before he even gets the chance of firing the first bullet, I rush to tackle him. I honestly wasn't thinking straight. Looking back, I guess I just didn't want anyone to be killed or something, I couldn't stand losing anyone of my classmates.

The problem was, I accidentally slightly pushed back an innocent classmate who was in between the shooter and me by trying to tackle the shooter. I instantly felt bad but kept the plan of bringing the shooter to the ground before he could kill anyone.

Even though I succeeded in disarming him, I still felt bad. When everyone was thanking me and chanting my name while the cops arrested the shooter, all I could think of was how I accidentally pushed him. I told my volunteering group and the burned victims at the hospital I visit every single day and they all agree I did nothing wrong. I even spoke with the HIV kids after dressing like Spiderman and giving them toys and they agreed I did nothing wrong.

I spoke to him 3 days later after clearing my mind a little bit and he said, "Are you kidding me? You saved my life! I can't believe you feel bad about it. We all owe you, especially me after you revived my dad with CPR last year. I barely felt the hit".

I'm just confused... AITA?

I work at a casino and as far as deadend jobs go, it's probably one of the best ones as I make $15/hr + on average $10/hr in tips. Oh, and I get a break every hour, all paid.

But I loathe the idea of doing it for the rest of my life (at least full time) and I for some reason have this intense desire to do university.

The thing is I have a bad track record which scares me from going back and I already have debt.

Philosophy has been SUPER interesting to me as of lately and Discords like this one does make self-study way more attainable. But idk why, but despite hearing so many horror stories within the acadamia, I still for some reason want to persue it.

But I may just be going through my mid-youth crisis...

I do see many comments here from Orthodox Christians critiquing Doctor Craig (which is absolutely fine). I just want them to know he is one of the three people that led me to Orthodoxy.

Jordan Peterson, who is not even a Christian, began me on my journey to Orthodoxy when he was discussing his understanding of the Orthodox doctrine of Theosis to Ben Shapiro on the Dave Rubin Report.

These two non-Orthodox individuals were the two main reasons I began studying Orthodoxy and now seek to become a catechumen.

The third was Sam Shamoun, who is also on a journey lead by the Spirit (who now accepts the communion of saints). Sam, during his journey, had hosted Jay Dyer. Jay pieced the theology together for me and helped me overcome my Protestant misconceptions of Orthodoxy.

Praise the Holy Spirit for guiding me in exodus from the fruitless churches I had been attending in Protestant Canada. Glory to God, who uses unexpected people and methods to lead men and women to Truth.

---NEW---
The truth is that Aristotle, with his immense genius, with his colossal logic, with his vast knowledge of biology, is deficient in one faculty and one faculty alone.

He is not a Platonist; and therefore he has a tendency to be fucking stupid.

Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that have been produced by Platonism; they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the main, and from the beginning of time, Platonism has kept men sane. The thing that has driven them mad was logic.

...The only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has been Platonism— the belief that appearances are misleading, and that reality is not what it seems.

Our pronouns suffer grammatical lacks that can be acutely felt, and that can only be made up by prohibitively awkward paraphrases.

We continually stumble over the ambiguity between plural and singular you, and between the we that includes the interlocutor and the we that excludes him. In these cases we are quite aware that we are limping.

Our southern compatriots have conjured up you all in desperation, and the New York Irish youse.
The French have accommodated the other problem with nous autres.
The Spaniards also resorted to the latter expedient, with nosotros;
but it lost its force and took on the indiscriminate sense again of we.

It even induced an analogous second-person vosotros, though in the second person there was no similar distinction to be drawn.

We rightly wonder at the Darwinian finesse with which language has warped itself to our developing needs without our conscious intervention.

We may wonder the more, then, at these cases to the contrary.

The ambiguity of you (and vous) as between singular and plural is particularly remarkable, for it was only the effete use of plural for polite singular that brought it about; the distinction between singular and plural had been admirably under control with thou and ye, thee and you, tu and vous.

"A difficulty is a light," Paul Valery wrote.

"An insurmountable difficulty is a sun." Any occult phenomenon-any clear case of telepathy, teleportation, or clairvoyance, a ghost, a flying saucer-any of these would delight the scientific mind. Scientists would withdraw in droves and glee to their drawing
boards and linear accelerators. The mechanisms of the occult phenomena would cry out for investigation, and a basic revolution in physics would be on the way.

The thought of such glory has power to lend credence to anomalous happenings, through wishful thinking. And yet the more surprising a thing would be, if true, the less likely it is; this is what makes it surprising. So we witness here a certain tension in the scientific breast-the sort of thing some of my students used to call a dialectic.

Thus torn, what does the scientist do? Ideally he scrutinizes the purported anomaly with a sharp and skeptical eye, determined to detect fraud or illusion or some commonplace cause, while still hoping against hope that the phenomenon will withstand his scrutiny and turn out to be the world-shaking prodigy that it seems.

1. My idea of Ben Shapiro is a philosopher of which no greater can be conceived.
2. The idea of the greatest of all philosophers that can be conceived exists in my understanding.
3. A Ben Shaprio which exists both in the understanding and in reality is greater than a Ben Shapiro that exists only in my understanding.
4. If Ben Shapiro only exists in my understanding, then I can conceive of a greater philosopher—a Ben Shapiro that exists in reality.
5. This leads to a contradiction: I can conceive of a Ben Shapiro who is greater than Ben Shapiro.
6. Therefore, Ben Shapiro exists in reality.

I’m a 27/M who grew up in a trailer park in a poor rural area in Stagira.

At the age of 15, my dad told me to work in this factory working 9/hr 60 hours a week because “it was a good job” and i went into work at 5:30 am and got home at 2 pm, and from 2pm-2am I would play WoW and league of legends all day. I was eating terrible, sleeping terrible, suffering from depression, severe social anxiety, and anorexia(110 lbs 5’8”). My life was passing away fast and at one point I took a hard look at myself and asked not only if I’m happy, but is this all I want out of life?

Now I attend the Academy in Athens pursuing a bachelors in Dialectics, am set to work a remote internship in Elea that’s much more money than I’ve ever made, I’m an extrovert/center of attention thats usually the leader/initiator in conversations, and now I’m 150 lbs, I diet well and go to the gym. Im still relatively skinny, but considering where I started I’m very content with myself and proud of my progress.

So many times I would look at others and wish that things came easy to me like them, but eventually I fixed my mindset and worked hard to get to where I am now. This is not me saying “pull yourself up by your bootstraps”, but you would be surprised what you’re capable of when you finally start applying yourself.

And yea there are things you can’t change. You can’t change your height, your connection to the Macedonian royal family, or your past. But ignore the things you cannot change, and change the things you cannot ignore.

I’m going to post them here some of current projects:

I don’t care about the grammar mistakes in my LinkedIn posts.

Because I write as I speak. And as far as I am concerned it shouldn’t matter unless you are writing a letter to the Queen of England.

And maybe there are some spelling mistakes, my pronunciation isn’t really clear, some of the sentences make no sense at all.

But it doesn’t stop me from doing what I love.

You can hide behind your fear, bring excuses, be afraid to be wrong or to look stupid. But you miss the whole fun part of it.

No matter what you do or say, there will always be a group of people who will judge you. So… Instead of focusing on what people will think about your art, your post, your life… why wouldn’t you focus on what really matters: YOU!

Wear these shorts you always wanted, share this picture of the nature you took 3 weeks ago, publish that article you wrote. Don’t hesitate to express yourself.

I can’t promise you standing ovations, but eventually, you will definitely feel free, feel more confident and comfortable with who you are and what you represent.

-If I remember correctly, Attic pastries are bad. This is some food for thought.
-This is a 100% true, secularization is not the only way modernity will play out.
-I'd say we should live in accordance to nature.
-What you say makes a lot of sense, what justifies equality?
-I'm not questioning your judgement or anything, but is suicide the ultimate philosophical problem?
