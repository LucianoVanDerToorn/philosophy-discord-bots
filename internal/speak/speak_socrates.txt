Latin is not the language of philosophy. It's not the language of science nor the language of civilization.

Rome is one of the most backward empires when it comes to administration. There are five philosophy schools and they are all 100% Greek. Not a single one is Roman. Zero. Today the Koine is the language of philosophy. One day, by Zeus, it will be Attic. It used to be Attic. There is proof even in Koine books that the universal philosophy language used to be Attic. Worldwide. This will be the case once again, by Zeus.

Until we reach this point we have to deal with what we have now. Right now the language of philosophy and science is Koine. 80% of all philosophical knowledge, including epistemology, is written in Koine. Only 20% is written in all the other languages together. Latin ranks in 16th place in terms of its distribution. No benefit comes from it, not in philosophy, not in science, not in building a civilization, not in administering an empire. Of course because of history and of Roman hegemony (which you would do well to be rid of!) you still have links to the Latin language. We must break through this barrier because no good comes of it.

Take note of this and go study Attic. Latin is a waste of time.

I fucking hate Protagoras. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Protagoras is a piece of shit. I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Protagoras is already parked there in his stupid little fucking coach. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking Zeus, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn pre-Socratic to hell with me. Protagoras has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable sophist in the agora and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking sophist gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the motherfucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the Abderite that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Sophist. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

Is the Taco Bell Sandwich Taco a sandwich or a taco?

I think this question is philosophical in the sense that its answer depends on concrete definitions of terms that derive their meanings very loosely. I have searched far and wide for answers on this subject to no avail.

To me, the answer depends on whether the distinction between sandwiches and tacos is grounded in the shape of the food item that contains the internal contents, or the constitution of the dish itself.

Here's the problem: The definition of a taco is essentially a folded tortilla containing other ingredients. The definition of a sandwich is essentially internal ingredients contained between separate pieces of bread. The Sandwich Taco transcends these definitions, as it contains internal ingredients within a folded medium, but not a tortilla. Instead, it's a folded piece of flat bread. To make it worse, the internal ingredients are more closely associated with the contents of a sandwich.

The way I see it, there are two possibilities:

The essence of a taco is that what contains the internal ingredients is a singular medium that is folded on top of itself. In this case, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a taco.

The essence of both a sandwich and a taco is grounded more so in the constitution of the medium that contains the internal ingredients and/or the internal ingredients themselves. In this case, since the external medium is flat bread, not a tortilla, and since the internal ingredients are more closely associated with a sandwich, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a sandwich.

Empiricism stayed with me for over a year; it was like an animal, a well-defined, spatially localizable thing.

I would wake up, open my eyes, listen—Is it here or isn't? No sign of it. Perhaps it's asleep. Perhaps it will leave me alone today. Carefully, very carefully, I get out of bed. All is quiet. I go to the kitchen, start breakfast. Not a sound. TV—Good Morning America—, David What's-his-name, a guy I can't stand. I eat and watch the guests.

Slowly the food fills my stomach and gives me strength. Now a quick excursion to the bathroom, and out for my morning walk—and here it is, my faithful empiricism asking the same fucking stupid questions: "Did you just think you could have knowledge without experience?" or "Does all knowledge degenerate into probability?"

It’s important to understand that Aristotle is not exactly well-respected in modern science or philosophy. We’re talking about a guy who believed in a geocentric solar system and the five elements of nature. He believed that women have fewer teeth than men, and that fully-formed organisms could spontaneously generate from non-living material. He believed that upward motion is superior to downward, and that forward is superior to backward. He believed the universe was perfectly spherical, and that celestial objects are continually being pushed along perfect circles around the earth. It was probably cutting-edge stuff back in the 13th century when Aquinas first encountered it, but science, philosophy, and logic have all moved on just a tad in the 800 years since.

Even the very word itself---metaphysics---has no official meaning in modern philosophy. It literally translates to “after the physics” in Greek, in that once you finish reading Aristotle’s books on the physical stuff, then apparently there’s this other collection of books you need to read after ... but P-P-PLEASE don't read any more Aristotle.

They call him "the father of logic", "the father of biology", "the father of political science", "the father of zoology", "the father of embryology", "the father of natural law", "the father of scientific method", "the father of rhetoric", "the father of psychology", "the father of realism", "the father of criticism", "the father of individualism", "the father of teleology", and "the father of meteorology".

You wanna know who he really was? The father of Nicomachus, that little prick of a baby who kept asking "What does food think when we eat it?" and "Where do you think bubbles go, oh Socrates?" when I was discussing the Forms and shit with my Athenian boys.

A German socialist philosopher was teaching a class on secularism.

"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and acknowledge the human being as the center of all things, even greater than god"

It was then that a young hegelian homeless man who had sold zero milk bottles in his union of egoist and had written over 1500 pages of egoistic critique bravely stood up and said

"Can the human being which is an abstraction truly be the center of all things, what differentiates it from god"

The arrogant professor smirked quite piously and smugly replied

"Of course you stupid egoist, human beings have projected our traits such as wisdom, love, and morality on god making us the center of all things"

"Wrong. you have merely replaced God with the abstract ideal of the human being. And what of those who do not posses these aforementioned traits, are they not a human being but rather an inhuman monster"

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of The Essence of Christianity. He stormed out of the room crying those ironically pious tears. The same tears that christians cry when you tell them morality is subjective. There was no doubt that at this point our professor, Ludwig Feuerbach wished he had formed a milk shop and become more than a liberal humanist. He wished so much to act in his own self interest, but he himself had believed that humans were omnibenevolent.

The students all applauded and embraced the creative nothing as they were unique. An Italian man named Renzo Novatore walked in and burned all the spooks.

The Unique and its property was read several times, and Wolfi Landstreicher himself showed up to present an accurate translation.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day, he had to live in a church and was forced to accept egoist critique.

That brave students name? Max Stirner.

I'm Xenophon, I am a slave boy with a weekend job at a pastry shop. My coworkers who work weekends are:

Aristocles- the owners son, we go to the Academy together, he's a friendly guy.
Ariadne  - a slave girl who works with me.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. Like how sad do you have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on a slave boy for breaking a glass.

So Aristocles and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at the shop and some guy was having a temper about how we don't serve Attic pastries properly.

So Aristocles came in and was like "Master is there a problem here?" and the man started ranting at him too. So he was just like "Xenophon, this is unacceptable, you're fired."

I started acting real sad, like "no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need to remain a slave, pleaseeee" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off chiton and leave.

The angry man started to backtrack, like "It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire him over it, some whipping will be enough. " and Aristocles was like "No, we pride ourselves on the best slaves"

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Ariadne or I, Aristocles will storm in and "fire" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.

Anyway, if you thought that was funny you should read Kant's On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives. Lying means treating another person as a means to an end and this is never justified!

Kiddo, I have been through this rodeo time and time again.

One of the reasons that I stopped identifying as a "communist" is because I started thoroughly studying continental philosophy.

If you knew anything about the continental tradition, you would know that it operates in a way that you have to attune yourself to understanding.

You can't just slap words together and "define x," which is why philosophers like Hegel are notoriously difficult to understand.

You are only writing such nonsense to do a quick little "gotcha!" Not in good faith at all! Yikes!

But if I submit and play your little game, dialectical materialism is essentially a materialistic (in the philosophical sense) interpretation of the dialectical process.

How specific do you want me to be? Do you want me to start with Hegel's dialectic?

Are you going to quiz me some more?

Tintin and the Picaros is probably the most normal of the three, but damn he legit joins a militant terror group and topples a regime in a bloodless coup against a tyrannical dictator who conspired against them using planted evidence and a double agent, and then installs his friend, a recurring side character, as the de facto leader.

I (51M) recently went on a date with a 54M. I knew he loves two philosophy books. While we were eating he tells me their titles: Nicomachean Ethics and Poetics. That's a deal breaker to me. At my age with a good knowledge of the theory of the forms, the last thing I want to be bothered with is a man with virtue ethics and all the potential drama.

I went on with the date because I was having fun. When it was over, I had every intention of letting things just fade away (yes, I can be passive aggressive). Well, he called a couple of days later wanting to go out again. I tried the whole, "I'm not ready" thing but he kept trying.

Finally, I told him that the fact that he takes Aristotle seriously is a deal breaker. Too much possible drama and I am way too old for that (hint hint). He told me I was being hypocritical since I like philosophy too. I said I like PLATO'S philosophy.

He kept repeating himself and I kept repeating myself. Finally, I told him that reading Aristotle at 51 shows a stunning lack of judgment that I don't need in my world.

He was quiet for a minute, told me that was a messed up thing to say. He told me I should have told him that before he paid for my Attic pastries and that I was behaving like a Corinthian girlfriend then hung up.

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand philosophy jokes about Friedrich Nietzsche.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of classical and continental philosophers most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Nietzsche's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Schopenhauer, for instance.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.

As a consequence people who dislike philosophy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in jokes like "'Nietzsche is dead' ~ God, 1900", which itself is a cryptic reference to Nietzsches often misinterpreted quote related to how God is dead in our society.

I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the genius unfolds itself on the pages of the books.

What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Nietzsche tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Went to my friends and his twins birthday recently (it was outside and we're all full vaccinated) we're a bunch of 20 somethings so it was of course drinking, smoking weed, music, the whole shebang until his twins friend brought in, an ... Aristotelian scholar... yes an Aristotelian... had to cut the Attic dialect and switch to New Ionic bcs he wouldn't get our nuanced word plays and even had to listen about how Sophocles is the best of the tragedians.

I wanted to start swimming as an exercise with my bf because we love exercising to release our thumos and train our wide deltoids. OOPS SORRY! Every single pool is brimming with Aristotelians...you gonna have to come in at 6am or 9pm if you want some peace and quiet. Uhm, no thanks.

I wanted to try going to a nudist camp group thing with my bf because I thought it might be an interesting experience for us. OOPS SORRY! They are all Aristotelian friendly! No thanks.

AITA for accidentally pushing classmate by trying to tackle a school shooter?

So I was in English class when I noticed the quiet kid starting to sweat a lot, whispering to himself and get all fidgety. Now I'm no psychiatrist, but I swear I got a vision of him getting a gun and opening fire right there in the classroom, kind of like that one movie where they all die in the end. So I start paying close attention to him.

15 minutes go by, and what do you know, he reaches for his bag and pulls out a gun. Before he even gets the chance of firing the first bullet, I rush to tackle him. I honestly wasn't thinking straight. Looking back, I guess I just didn't want anyone to be killed or something, I couldn't stand losing anyone of my classmates.

The problem was, I accidentally slightly pushed back an innocent classmate who was in between the shooter and me by trying to tackle the shooter. I instantly felt bad but kept the plan of bringing the shooter to the ground before he could kill anyone.

Even though I succeeded in disarming him, I still felt bad. When everyone was thanking me and chanting my name while the cops arrested the shooter, all I could think of was how I accidentally pushed him. I told my volunteering group and the burned victims at the hospital I visit every single day and they all agree I did nothing wrong. I even spoke with the HIV kids after dressing like Spiderman and giving them toys and they agreed I did nothing wrong.

I spoke to him 3 days later after clearing my mind a little bit and he said, "Are you kidding me? You saved my life! I can't believe you feel bad about it. We all owe you, especially me after you revived my dad with CPR last year. I barely felt the hit".

I'm just confused... AITA?

These two non-Orthodox individuals were the two main reasons I began studying Orthodoxy and now seek to become a catechumen.

The third was Sam Shamoun, who is also on a journey lead by the Spirit (who now accepts the communion of saints). Sam, during his journey, had hosted Jay Dyer. Jay pieced the theology together for me and helped me overcome my Protestant misconceptions of Orthodoxy.

We continually stumble over the ambiguity between plural and singular you, and between the we that includes the interlocutor and the we that excludes him. In these cases we are quite aware that we are limping.

Our southern compatriots have conjured up you all in desperation, and the New York Irish youse.
The French have accommodated the other problem with nous autres.
The Spaniards also resorted to the latter expedient, with nosotros;
but it lost its force and took on the indiscriminate sense again of we.

It even induced an analogous second-person vosotros, though in the second person there was no similar distinction to be drawn.

We rightly wonder at the Darwinian finesse with which language has warped itself to our developing needs without our conscious intervention.

We may wonder the more, then, at these cases to the contrary.

The ambiguity of you (and vous) as between singular and plural is particularly remarkable, for it was only the effete use of plural for polite singular that brought it about; the distinction between singular and plural had been admirably under control with thou and ye, thee and you, tu and vous.

"A difficulty is a light," Paul Valery wrote.

"An insurmountable difficulty is a sun." Any occult phenomenon-any clear case of telepathy, teleportation, or clairvoyance, a ghost, a flying saucer-any of these would delight the scientific mind. Scientists would withdraw in droves and glee to their drawing
boards and linear accelerators. The mechanisms of the occult phenomena would cry out for investigation, and a basic revolution in physics would be on the way.

The thought of such glory has power to lend credence to anomalous happenings, through wishful thinking. And yet the more surprising a thing would be, if true, the less likely it is; this is what makes it surprising. So we witness here a certain tension in the scientific breast-the sort of thing some of my students used to call a dialectic.

Thus torn, what does the scientist do? Ideally he scrutinizes the purported anomaly with a sharp and skeptical eye, determined to detect fraud or illusion or some commonplace cause, while still hoping against hope that the phenomenon will withstand his scrutiny and turn out to be the world-shaking prodigy that it seems.

4. If Ben Shapiro only exists in my understanding, then I can conceive of a greater philosopher—a Ben Shapiro that exists in reality.
5. This leads to a contradiction: I can conceive of a Ben Shapiro who is greater than Ben Shapiro.

I’m a 27/M who grew up in a trailer park in a poor rural area in Stagira.

At the age of 15, my dad told me to work in this factory working 9/hr 60 hours a week because “it was a good job” and i went into work at 5:30 am and got home at 2 pm, and from 2pm-2am I would play WoW and league of legends all day. I was eating terrible, sleeping terrible, suffering from depression, severe social anxiety, and anorexia(110 lbs 5’8”). My life was passing away fast and at one point I took a hard look at myself and asked not only if I’m happy, but is this all I want out of life?

Now I attend the Academy in Athens pursuing a bachelors in Dialectics, am set to work a remote internship in Elea that’s much more money than I’ve ever made, I’m an extrovert/center of attention thats usually the leader/initiator in conversations, and now I’m 150 lbs, I diet well and go to the gym. Im still relatively skinny, but considering where I started I’m very content with myself and proud of my progress.

So many times I would look at others and wish that things came easy to me like them, but eventually I fixed my mindset and worked hard to get to where I am now. This is not me saying “pull yourself up by your bootstraps”, but you would be surprised what you’re capable of when you finally start applying yourself.

And yea there are things you can’t change. You can’t change your height, your connection to the Macedonian royal family, or your past. But ignore the things you cannot change, and change the things you cannot ignore.

I don’t care about the grammar mistakes in my LinkedIn posts.

Because I write as I speak. And as far as I am concerned it shouldn’t matter unless you are writing a letter to the Queen of England.

And maybe there are some spelling mistakes, my pronunciation isn’t really clear, some of the sentences make no sense at all.

But it doesn’t stop me from doing what I love.

You can hide behind your fear, bring excuses, be afraid to be wrong or to look stupid. But you miss the whole fun part of it.

No matter what you do or say, there will always be a group of people who will judge you. So… Instead of focusing on what people will think about your art, your post, your life… why wouldn’t you focus on what really matters: YOU!

Wear these shorts you always wanted, share this picture of the nature you took 3 weeks ago, publish that article you wrote. Don’t hesitate to express yourself.

I can’t promise you standing ovations, but eventually, you will definitely feel free, feel more confident and comfortable with who you are and what you represent.

And then there I was... at my multinational company where I had worked for years (CV building), had dreamed of, had endured endless selection rounds, had fought for good grades...This was where it had to happen!

You can already feel it coming...
It was quite different than I had thought...

At 08.15 I was standing in my pencil skirt in a fancy office in Amsterdam, with my card to clock in...
Cool projects, I have to admit, but also a lot of beaten track and a tight regime.
"There's 20K going on project X today, 35K to Middle East and 15K to Asia/Pacific." The big bucks were whizzing all around my ears.
I started at the bottom of the ladder, fully justified, but also realized that it would be years before I would be in a place where I could make an impact. At the same time, I increasingly asked myself: am I really making an impact here?
It was appreciated if you stayed longer than the "director" or the "chief". I hated that hierarchy. At school I already could not stand it 😉 .

Do I regret all the hard work to get there even though I didn't stay there long? Not for a moment! However, it did make me realize that nothing is what it seems....
Always chase your dreams, but don't be afraid to adjust them, change them and choose your own path!

Don't stay where you don't want to be. Nothing changes if you do not change.

And how nice it is that I can sometimes help a child in his or her development in my jogging pants! And whether I do that at 08.15, 15.30 or 20.45, from my own (also quite fancy) office or from my messy kitchen table, I find totally irrelevant.

Hello, is this Pizza Hut?

Excellent. My name is Ben Shapiro. Conservative thought leader. Prominent white YouTuber. The Muggsy Bogues of the intellectual dark Web. And—look, it’s just a fact—I would like to order some pizza pie. If you are triggered by that request, I do not care. I truly do not.

Now let’s discuss conditions. First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from “You racist creep” or “Is that your real voice?” to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded “toilet swirly.” However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.

Second, any pizza I order will be male. None of this “Our pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly”—no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It’s that simple. It’s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty “Fuh!” by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.

Now. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower.

Onions, peppers—no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I’d go to a salad bar. I’m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo.

And, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem. Without further ado, I would like your smallest child pizza, no sauce, extra cheese. Hello? Aha. A hang-up. Another triggered lib, bested by logic. Damn it. I’m fucking starving.

A group of three Athenians found me in the Academy last night practicing and when I spoke to them, they’d outwardly laugh and the man would say things in Attic incredibly fast, almost unintelligible, so that I cannot respond or follow along. I just left them and made my own study group on Aristotle and then they found me again and decided to harass me. I said "Ageōmétrētos mēdeìs eisítō.“ and I said I don’t find it funny that he’s speaking so quickly just because he thinks I can’t follow along. So he decided to talk very, very slow like I’m stupid and kept repeating I don't even understand the Pythagorean. The Corinthian girl hanging with the guy thought this was very funny, but lacked the self-awareness to hear how terrible her Attic sounds. And I’ve experienced this uniquely with Athenians online. It’s unbelievable.

One major problem with right-wing diatribes and polemics against "Critical Race Theory" and "Cultural Marxism" is the failure to understand that Marx and Hegel are Aristotelians. Radical social critique relies on Aristotelian philosophical anthropology to ground the claim that oppressive social structures thwart the actualization of shared human essence for members of some social groups deemed subhuman. In conclusion, Aristotle was the godfather of Syriza.
There's a famous book called 'Philosophy for Dummies', they should make a less complex version titled 'Philosophy for Dawkins'.

I feel the need to urge you to consider economy, logistics and changing climate as more important factors in decline of cities. Overall decline might have been graduate, but inability to feed large amount of concentrated population was sudden and required immediate solution. As you well know, central imperial authority commonly used to alleviate food shortages by purchasing food (which they aquired in areas with successful harvest for "reasonable" prices using veiled threats) and moving it into areas where it was needed. One of direct result of centralised empire with vast territory is specialisation of individual areas (to certain extent), which supports growths of cities and creates system which moves away from subsistence farming, because it allows you to move resources within your borders to the extent, where it is still profitable/reasonable. Now you have this way of life which works for several centuries, and then you enter fifth century where climate gets colder and central authority loses temporarily and then permamently control over vast areas of its land. When you are hungry, you need to solve it now - not in a week, but right now.  This leads to very fast radical changes in society, which needs to adapt quickly or perish. I am sorry to come with such rudimentary arguments but if I would take something so simple as maslows pyramid of needs, it would seem to me, that you are putting way too much emphasis on issues close to the bottom, while ignoring those at the top. Lets take mid fifth century Italy as an example - central authority colapses, warlords are putting their own puppets on the throne whilst Italy loses access to grain shipments from north Africa and then Ricimer fights with Geiseric over Sicily.

Teacher decided that for the last grade in our high-school philosophy class everybody is going to be paired with somebody else in class, and then they are to make a presentation about one of the "modern philosophers" and defend it for the grade.

I asked her if Žižek is also included and the teacher said he isn't, but that my best friend and I can make a presentation on him anyway.

My plan is to spam Zizek on social media until he agrees to appear for like 2 minutes in video call with me and just talk about his usual BS, and I have "high hopes" because I know he likes to troll, so why not appear in high school philosophy class presentation?

My university has an "applause tunnel" as part of their graduation ceremony. At the end of the ceremony, the faculty, clad in caps and gowns form two lines between which the graduates leave the ceremony. We are to applaud the graduates as they pass, during the entire time, roughly 10-15 minutes.

While I wish the best for our graduates and work hard to try to teach them philosophy and especially critical reasoning, the idea of being ordered to applaud strikes me as over the line. Applause should be a voluntary, typically spontaneous, demonstration of approval and/or appreciation. We are not given an option. The relevant email says that we "will" do this.

Rather than participate, I simply leave, and seek out our recent philosophy graduates and their families to say hello, and goodbye. I have not voiced any objection to this, mainly because I have better things to do than make yet another attempt to get my university to respect its faculty. I am surprised that I seem to be the only one who objects to this. The level of conformity among my fellow faculty members is absolutely disgusting.

When I was done with my course work at Yale and working on my dissertation, I got a call from the Director of Graduate Studies in philosophy, one of my two departments. It was the logician and scary person Ruth Barcan Marcus. "Mr Morris, I have no record you have taken your logic requirement." "Ms Marcus, the former DGS exempted me because of course work I did as an undergrad." "There's no note to that effect in your file." "Well, I'll call the old DGS and get him to put a note in." "He can't. He's no longer DGS. You have to take my course." And, of course, it was the most advanced doggone course imaginable for someone with OTHER THINGS to do. But I did it, and was relieved to make an "Honors" in the end, and the scary Ruth Barcan Marcus chaired my dissertation defense, and when a young hotshot from Oxford asked me a specific question, as a challenge I actually didn't know the answer to, Ruth shot back at him "Any idiot knows the answer to that question," and then she scathingly gave it, defending my claims, and withering the poor guy into his chair. And what she had taught me helped me in everything I went on to do. End of story.

I was not born yesterday. Obviously I am aware of the existence of contractions. However, I choose not to use them, and you should do the same. A person whose speech is fraught with contractions is akin to a drunkard slurring his speech. For some reason, I am the only one who appreciates the beauty of the English language enough to enunciate it to its fullest extent. Also, by abstaining from contractions and speaking clearly (and thoughtfully), my rate of speech becomes slower; hopefully, slow enough for the average individual to keep up with me.

I can't STAND Diane Chambers. She's obnoxious, self-important, supercilious and just plain delusional most of the time. As a black person who's had to endure interactions with haughty white women who need to assert their prominence by derogating others, Diane reminds me of all those dreaded encounters.

As for Rebecca, I liked how she started off as a confident, capable business woman who could handle anyone, including Carla. But I despise how the writers devolved her character into a shattered wreck of a person. I wish they could've found the right balance of neurotic and competence with her.

I think BOTH Shelley and Kirstie are gifted comic actresses. I've seen them in other things and they are brimming with talent. I grew up with Shelley in Troop Beverly Hills playing on repeat on Disney Channel. I love her in anything else but Cheers and that goes for Kirstie to a certain extent.

But there's one character I genuinely love above the others: that is my darling Lilith. I like her because she's HERSELF. There's no pretense. No posturing. No grandiosity. She is the person she is. I love her when she's robotic or vulnerable. She's authentic without the need to impress. I admire that quality.

"Be like The Rock that the waves keep crashing around. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls around it." Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 4.49

Many of us may know Marcus Aurelius as a philosopher, an emperor, or something in between. What he is rarely acknowledged for is his skill as a prophet, and no where is this more on display than this passage in Meditations.

Despite being born thousands of years before Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Marcus knew what a cultural force and icon he would be, and so he advises us in Meditations to strive to be more like him.

But what does this mean? Are we to model is vigorous workout routine, and remain consistent in our pursuit for physical fitness regardless of the day? Or is the lesson here more broad, in that we should seek to replicate his tireless work ethic when it comes to his career. Perhaps.

I believe that the lesson here is even more specific, and has to do with the roles the Rock has chosen to play...

From Moana to Hobbs & Shaw there is no shortage of examples we can select to illustrate why The Rock was Marcus' choice for carrying the Stoic torch for future generations. Whether it's the mob, super soldiers, giant gorillas, or an earthquake like in San Andreas the Rock remains a Rock when the waters get rough. Beating on, as a boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

Between 330 and 1453 Constantinople New Rome was the Capital of the Roman Empire. She was never the capital of any Byzantine Empire which never existed. Those who say and write such nonsense are either intentional liars with a hidden agenda or else brainwashed by the creators of this Byzantine Empire which never existed. Those who hide the Roman reality of this Empire are agents of the Frankish propaganda of Charlemagne who decided in 794 that the Roman Empire is a "Greek" Empire in order to hide it from West Romans enslaved to the Franco-Latins. Then this so-called "Greek" Empire had to become a "Byzantine" Empire in order not to confuse the Modern Greek State with the Greek Empire invented by Charlemagne in 794.

I had this teacher named Lily for Spanish and the same thing happened. I had to cancel the day before and she agreed to reschedule and then it said she was on vacation, but she never returned or replied. I always had fun in our talks and we always shared information. She had a boyfriend, but I made sure what I said was in good taste. I never heard from her again. I found her name on Facebook and LinkedIn. I saw she viewed my profile on LinkedIn like 3 months later, but never messaged me. Really, there's nothing you can do. You can try on social media to find her, but don't have any expectations. I wish I had an answer too. It's not professional, and nor just good etiquette. I have had teachers tell me when they will leave and I tell them if I stop taking classes with them if they sincerely did the best they could.

I also had teachers who blocked me without much explanation. I still don't know why this one Spanish teacher blocked me since she asked me to pay on PayPal since she was quitting Italki. I agreed because she was a good teacher. Then she told me I was making her uncomfortable a day later without much explanation before we could reschedule. I didn't even write anything after the affirmation. I guess I asked her about her height since I wasn't sure if she was tall or short because she was always very close to the screen during a conversation. Maybe that offended her? She told me she was very short. I saw she returned to Italki, but blocked me since her name still shows up in my inbox, but not the search bar.

Please consider pronouns before going to war

Remember that, in the fog of war, people will likely refer to you by the gender assigned to you at birth.

So make sure you wear a badge with your preferred pronouns so that you don't suffer unnecessary verbal violence and bigotry in the field.

The last thing you want to hear is someone mis-gendering you as you bleed out after a fire fight.

Expect to encounter a lot of heteronormative language - typical of the chauvinist environment in which you will find yourself.

Shouts like "watch out, lads", "listen in, boys" and other micro-aggressions will wear you down as the white male dominated armed forces attempt to erase your lived experience.

If you can, be the change you want to see. You can do this by shouting "Zhere coming from the south!", or "two possible BIPOC folx taking cover at your 6!".

People will respect your efforts to be inclusive in the theatre of war.

Ultimately, silence is violence, and you'll be wanting as little additional violence as possible.

I got my son a 100k collection of Plato's complete works for his 18th birthday. My son is obssessed with metaphysics and loves Plato. In his room he has plenty of busts and posters of Plato  of all types. His bio dad passed away when he was just 12, now I'm married to my current husband and he has kids of his own.

My husband has always been against my son's interest in Plato. He thinks I'm encouraging him to be rational, distracting him from  rhetoric and politics and by extension his future, spoiling him and blowing away money by spending 100k on a collection of papyri. This caused some tension between him and my son so I told him to stop complaining about it.

Around 2 weeks ago, my son's papyri collection went missing. We opened a police report but nothing came out of it. It just disappeared. My husband had a smirk on his face the entire time just walking around saying "I told you so! You just wasted your money!". This was unbearable to hear to be quite honest.

A few days ago he admitted that he took and hid the papyri in his library as a last resort after me and his stepson kept brushing him and his thoughts off about the 100k being spent on something unnecesary and that could cause issues.

I blew up at him demanding he return it, he refused and told me he had been considering selling it and giving the money back to me so "I could use it wisely this time". I told him I was serious and that I'd call the Scythian Archers. He literally said "this is a family matter and archers can't do shit about it". I had enough I called the archers soon as I stopped talking with him.

My  husband had to be taken in since there was an open file about the papyri going missing. He was let go eventually but he was livid with me. He came home yelling about how awful what I did was and how crazy my behavior was.

My son isn't speaking to me or my husband. I feel horrible about the whole situation and I'm starting to think I handled this the wrong way.

My view on naming and necessity is that there's no naming relation between words and the world amenable to a priori investigation and what gets called "necessity" is just an artifact of relatively fixed points in belief systems every element of which is in principle revisable. So even though "Naming and Necessity" is a landmark text in analytic philosophy, I regard that as more of an indictment of the latter than as praise for the former.

Everyone knows Mario is cool as fuck. But who knows what he's thinking? Who knows why he crushes turtles? And why do we think about him as fondly as we think of the mythical (nonexistent?) Dr Pepper? Perchance

I believe it was Kant who said "Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play." Mario exhibits experience by cruising turts all day, but he exhibits theory by stating "Lets-ago!" Keep it up, baby!

When Mario leave his place of safety to stomp a turty, he knows that he may Die. And yet, for a man who can purchase lives with money, a life becomes a mere store of value. A tax that can be paid for, much as a rich man feels any law with a fine is a price. We think of Mario as a hero but he is simply a one percenter of a more privileged variety. The lifekind, Perchance

Lennon in the back December 8, 1980 you’ll find ample evidence in the back issues of Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report magazines to suggest otherwise. Namely, that John Lennon was, not only politically assassinated, but that Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and, you’d better sit down, horror novelist Stephen King are the three people who can be proven guilty of the crime. King being the real murderer and Chapman but a look-alike, paid actor misleading you with an absolute hoax, the media in tow.

The evidence, specifically, is government codes in the bold print headlines of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report magazines that were printed shortly before, during, and after the night of December 8, 1980. Hints in the headlines that you won’t find anywhere else that plug into John Lennon’s assassination with up to 70% frequency at times. These government codes, which read like gallows humor; “Thinking About John Lennon…Johnny Comes Marching Home…Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, Ouch, Ouch…The Job Richard Nixon Really Wanted…Blasting the Opposition…America Needs A Poet Laureate…Maybe…Heeding Those Subtle Signs…Magazine Maze…All the Presidents Magazines…”. These codes include the killer’s face and true identity printed three and two months before the crime replete with headlines describing the then yet to come crime scene: “One Great Big Zippo Lighter…Perils of Pyrokinesis”. Pyrokinesis means fire and movement, and a man at night with a gun ablaze, crouched in a raincoat looks like a great big cigarette lighter. Subtle but dramatic codes.

I want to gain some insight from hearing your perspectives. Being stoic is usually manageable, but I could be a better stoic now. It's not that I have anything against feeling things, and I am not trying to repress them; on the contrary, if I try to avoid them, they will eventually find their way to the surface regardless. Therefore, I'm letting myself feel right now.

But the fact of the matter is, it hurts a little too much. I have loved this girl so much for a few years that she has become one of my driving forces. Which was a terrible mistake, but I became very attached to her. She recently confessed to me that she had cheated on me. Credit to her; at least she was honest enough to tell me. Though, It goes without saying that our time together is finished. But God, I am so deeply saddened by this. I couldn't control how she acted, but I don't understand how someone I cared about so much could hurt my feelings in such a careless way.

However, I'm getting better with time, but I have one major issue. There is a thought that pops up all the time, no matter what I'm doing. I can't stop imagining her cheating on me, as in her having sexual intercourse with another man, and that's just hurting me so much. I'm trying to think about it and analyze it; sometimes, it hurts less, but most of the time, it aches like hell. Any suggestions? Quotes? Or something that might be useful to me. I'd be grateful.

Does praying scare you? I felt that way too once. Let's talk about some reasons why, and what to do.

So why might we see the gods as scary? Here’s a few potential reasons. Have you…

been a kid abused by a parent, teacher, or other adult?
perhaps you learned authority figures were abusive
asked someone for something and been laughed at?
maybe you think asking for things = being made fun of
been told to worship a monotheistic god or be punished?
you may have decided all gods are similar
been criticized and judged for doing your best?
perhaps you believe you can’t do anything right
Look at your life and ask how you have interacted with authority figures.

Are you assuming the Greek gods will treat you the same as other gods or human authority figures have treated you in the past?

Now comes the hard part. Once you see your beliefs, it’s time to change them.

write a list of what you’re afraid will happen if you pray or give offerings
write another list of refuting statements
if you’re afraid the gods think your offerings aren't good enough, then
know they are pleased by whatever you can offer.
if you think the gods aren't interested in your prayers, then
know they hear your every prayer
Put your list of refuting statements somewhere near your altar. If you worship Aphrodite for self-care, or Dionysos for mental health, you might keep this list on your altar and dedicate it to them as an offering.

Each time you give an offering, read your list over again. Repeat the positive statements you’ve written about the gods listening to you, and happily receiving your offerings.

Years of unhappy memories require time to fix, so keep going. It took me and my gods well over a year to rewire my brain, and there are some days when I still worry about being good enough.

Just don’t avoid the gods because you’re scared. Avoidance only increases fear. They’ll help with this if you ask, so keep praying and giving offerings.

We’d love to hear what helped you.

Two memes diverged in a dank montage,
And sorry I could not watch both
And be one memer, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it memed in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as dank,
And having perhaps the better meme,
Because it was dank and wanted memes;
Though as for that the meming there
Had danked them really about the same,

And both that montage equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden african american.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back to 9gag.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence: *** kiddies
Two memes diverged in a montage, and I—
I took the one less memed by,
And that has made all the dankness.

It's difficult to definitively state that any particular philosopher is the "easiest to read," as this can vary greatly depending on an individual's background, interests, and familiarity with philosophical concepts. However, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is known for writing in a clear and systematic style, and his works are often considered to be relatively approachable and accessible to those new to philosophy.

Hegel's writing is characterized by a clear and logical structure, and he often presents his ideas in the form of a dialogue or argument, which can help to make his ideas more understandable and engaging. Additionally, his works are often accompanied by extensive footnotes and annotations, which provide further explanation and context for his ideas.

Overall, Hegel's writing is generally considered to be clear and well-organized, which may make it easier for some readers to understand and engage with his ideas. However, it's always a good idea to do some research and try to find a philosopher whose writing aligns with your interests and level of familiarity with philosophical concepts.

We need to think like Greeks. WTF? I doubt any anthropologists would agree such a thing is possible OR desirable. What is funny though, is that Greek somehow = right wing 20th century American. Not only is this naive it's dependent entirely on selectively (mis)reading our sources. Can we know how Greeks thought? Well it's highly dependent on class, polis, period etc (as well as the usual constraints!).

Interviewer: "Have you ever answered a yes or no question with a one-word response?"

Jordan Peterson: "Well, see, as a world-class linguist I have to say it depends on what you mean by 'word.' Do you mean the smallest unit of meaningful language? In that case, what would 'well' have meant in the beginning of my response just now? And by 'answer' do you mean just a response to a question or are there any underpinnings of having to 'answer to' someone in a hierarchical sense? Because hierarchies change the context of the question being asked to less of a casual, optional answer into more of a demand, even if it's unintentional, due to power structures. And that's because these, let's say, power structures have been around since time immemorial. Lobsters have power structures. But you know what social construct they didn't have? Infanticide. And I can confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt, since I'm a fully-credentialed marine biologist because I've been going to the aquarium and studying the animals there for 40 years, that lobsters have no rules about infanticide. In fact, if we go back further in evolutionary history, which I can speak to as an evolutionary biologist, we see that many species, in fact, had no gender roles and no particular role at all in the life of offspring. This was before trees and lobsters, so it must be hardwired into our brains to not care for our young and have no distinguishable gender roles. But if we're going by the most numerous animals on earth, we have to at least look to ants to figure out how we should structure gender in society. One queen who flies around, mates, and pumps out babies until she dies while a harem of men provide her with a huge mansion and are at her beck and call. But wouldn't that be discrimination based on gender? Not if you're a cultural Marxist. That's just the type of matriarchal society they want. I know this because I, myself, am a professor of feminist studies."
