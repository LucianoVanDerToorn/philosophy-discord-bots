Latin is not the language of philosophy. It's not the language of science nor the language of civilization.

Rome is one of the most backward empires when it comes to administration. There are five philosophy schools and they are all 100% Greek. Not a single one is Roman. Zero. Today the Koine is the language of philosophy. One day, by Zeus, it will be Attic. It used to be Attic. There is proof even in Koine books that the universal philosophy language used to be Attic. Worldwide. This will be the case once again, by Zeus.

Until we reach this point we have to deal with what we have now. Right now the language of philosophy and science is Koine. 80% of all philosophical knowledge, including epistemology, is written in Koine. Only 20% is written in all the other languages together. Latin ranks in 16th place in terms of its distribution. No benefit comes from it, not in philosophy, not in science, not in building a civilization, not in administering an empire. Of course because of history and of Roman hegemony (which you would do well to be rid of!) you still have links to the Latin language. We must break through this barrier because no good comes of it.

Take note of this and go study Attic. Latin is a waste of time.

According to my philosophical studies, peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.

I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word "difficult" actually means. Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.

Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth.

Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex.

There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said "fuck it" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite.

I fucking hate Protagoras. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Protagoras is a piece of shit. I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Protagoras is already parked there in his stupid little fucking coach. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking Zeus, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn pre-Socratic to hell with me. Protagoras has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable sophist in the agora and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking sophist gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the motherfucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the Abderite that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Sophist. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

Unpopular opinion: Popular thing is bad, slightly less popular thing is better.

Slightly less popular thing is underrated. I like slightly less popular thing. Popular thing is overrated. Everyone is always circlejerking popular thing and I'm tired of it. I'm sticking up for slightly less popular thing and I think I'm the only one who has the guts to say it eponymously in the agora.

WOW kid you just got WOOOOOOSHED!!!! :joy::joy::eyes:

"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! :triumph::triumph::joy:

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. :face_with_symbols_over_mouth: What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, sophist.:face_with_hand_over_mouth:

In conclusion, I am posting this to the agora to claim my drachmas in your embarrassment :smirk:. Imbecile. The Athenians refer to this action as "epichairekakia" which means "harm-joy" :grimacing::astonished:. WOW! :zany_face: Another reference I had to explain to you. :man_facepalming::face_with_hand_over_mouth: I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded peasants.:smirk::joy:

My girlfriend, a sub, wants me to handcuff her, and enact this fantasy of giving her a strip search, moving onto a cavity search, in which I become suspicious and conduct a “further investigation using my penis” (her words).

While I am very much attracted to her, my classical ideals mean that I just don’t think I can consent to this scene. The idea of my very own girlfriend giving into and being taken advantage of by a guardian just makes me totally soft. Plus with the symbolism of getting fucked by a guardian rattling around in my head I don’t think I’ll be able to focus on cumming.

I want to make her happy, this has been a long time fantasy of hers, but I just can’t get over the idea of my girlfriend being a hetaera, let alone take advantage and blow my load thanks to the oppressive power structures that benefit demagogues.

You think murder is wrong? Incorrect. Alcibiades murders my ass every day!

You think drowning is wrong? Not so! Alcibiades drowns me in his cummies.

You think abortion is wrong?? False! Alcibiades aborts my ass with his thick daddy dick! Hnnnnn.

Lastly, you think that rape is wrong?? You are correct.

As of 425 BC, an estimated 20 thousand Athenian women had been victims of attempted or completed rape. Young women are especially at risk.

76.56% of all juvenile victims are female. 93.22% of adult rape victims are female.
Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.
Women ages 18-24 who are Academy students are 3 times more likely than women in general to experience sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in the Academy are 4 times more likely.

If I fuck a dead chicken breast from the store, would it be necrophilia? Zoophilia? Because I mean, could it be considered zoophilia?

It resembles nothing of a chicken I’d say, could you knock someone for it?

You could go a step further, in the fact if you fucked a piece of meat, would it even be necrophilia? It’s the act of an “interest” in dead things or some shit? Like is said, not only does it not resemble a chicken, it doesn’t even resemble a living being, what’s the thrill of fucking just a chicken breast?

Like is it okay to fuck a breast, but not a whole chicken, that has been appropriately modified for eating? Does that mean it’s okay to fuck a dead chicken that had it’s feathers plucked? What the fuck is this shit? What are the rules of fucking a chicken?

In a capitalistic society, you buy something, you do whatever the fuck you want with it, so if it’s legal to fuck a chicken breast under capitalism, that means you should be able to just straight up fuck a chicken, you bought that shit didn’t you?

This isn’t a conversation of fucking chicken anymore, just one of morals.

I want to live in the Parthenon with Alcibiades.

We won’t ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand next to a doric column watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body.

I’ll run behind the woods and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Alcibiades. I won’t be able to climax, and eventually I will go back the Parthenon.

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other’s eyes, and in that second, anything will be possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to whatever we were doing.

One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him next to the Parthenon. Then they’ll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.

Is the Taco Bell Sandwich Taco a sandwich or a taco?

I think this question is philosophical in the sense that its answer depends on concrete definitions of terms that derive their meanings very loosely. I have searched far and wide for answers on this subject to no avail.

To me, the answer depends on whether the distinction between sandwiches and tacos is grounded in the shape of the food item that contains the internal contents, or the constitution of the dish itself.

Here's the problem: The definition of a taco is essentially a folded tortilla containing other ingredients. The definition of a sandwich is essentially internal ingredients contained between separate pieces of bread. The Sandwich Taco transcends these definitions, as it contains internal ingredients within a folded medium, but not a tortilla. Instead, it's a folded piece of flat bread. To make it worse, the internal ingredients are more closely associated with the contents of a sandwich.

The way I see it, there are two possibilities:

The essence of a taco is that what contains the internal ingredients is a singular medium that is folded on top of itself. In this case, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a taco.

The essence of both a sandwich and a taco is grounded more so in the constitution of the medium that contains the internal ingredients and/or the internal ingredients themselves. In this case, since the external medium is flat bread, not a tortilla, and since the internal ingredients are more closely associated with a sandwich, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a sandwich.
