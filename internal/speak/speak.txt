Latin is not the language of philosophy. It's not the language of science nor the language of civilization.

Rome is one of the most backward empires when it comes to administration. There are five philosophy schools and they are all 100% Greek. Not a single one is Roman. Zero. Today the Koine is the language of philosophy. One day, by Zeus, it will be Attic. It used to be Attic. There is proof even in Koine books that the universal philosophy language used to be Attic. Worldwide. This will be the case once again, by Zeus.

Until we reach this point we have to deal with what we have now. Right now the language of philosophy and science is Koine. 80% of all philosophical knowledge, including epistemology, is written in Koine. Only 20% is written in all the other languages together. Latin ranks in 16th place in terms of its distribution. No benefit comes from it, not in philosophy, not in science, not in building a civilization, not in administering an empire. Of course because of history and of Roman hegemony (which you would do well to be rid of!) you still have links to the Latin language. We must break through this barrier because no good comes of it.

Take note of this and go study Attic. Latin is a waste of time.

According to my philosophical studies, peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.

I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word "difficult" actually means. Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.

Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth.

Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex.

There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said "fuck it" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite.

I fucking hate Protagoras. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Protagoras is a piece of shit. I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Protagoras is already parked there in his stupid little fucking coach. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking Zeus, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn pre-Socratic to hell with me. Protagoras has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable sophist in the agora and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking sophist gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the motherfucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the Abderite that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Sophist. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

My girlfriend, a sub, wants me to handcuff her, and enact this fantasy of giving her a strip search, moving onto a cavity search, in which I become suspicious and conduct a “further investigation using my penis” (her words).

While I am very much attracted to her, my classical ideals mean that I just don’t think I can consent to this scene. The idea of my very own girlfriend giving into and being taken advantage of by a guardian just makes me totally soft. Plus with the symbolism of getting fucked by a guardian rattling around in my head I don’t think I’ll be able to focus on cumming.

I want to make her happy, this has been a long time fantasy of hers, but I just can’t get over the idea of my girlfriend being a hetaera, let alone take advantage and blow my load thanks to the oppressive power structures that benefit demagogues.

You think murder is wrong? Incorrect. Alcibiades murders my ass every day!

You think drowning is wrong? Not so! Alcibiades drowns me in his cummies.

You think abortion is wrong?? False! Alcibiades aborts my ass with his thick daddy dick! Hnnnnn.

Lastly, you think that rape is wrong?? You are correct.

As of 425 BC, an estimated 20 thousand Athenian women had been victims of attempted or completed rape. Young women are especially at risk.

76.56% of all juvenile victims are female. 93.22% of adult rape victims are female.
Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.
Women ages 18-24 who are Academy students are 3 times more likely than women in general to experience sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in the Academy are 4 times more likely.

If I fuck a dead chicken breast from the store, would it be necrophilia? Zoophilia? Because I mean, could it be considered zoophilia?

It resembles nothing of a chicken I’d say, could you knock someone for it?

You could go a step further, in the fact if you fucked a piece of meat, would it even be necrophilia? It’s the act of an “interest” in dead things or some shit? Like is said, not only does it not resemble a chicken, it doesn’t even resemble a living being, what’s the thrill of fucking just a chicken breast?

Like is it okay to fuck a breast, but not a whole chicken, that has been appropriately modified for eating? Does that mean it’s okay to fuck a dead chicken that had it’s feathers plucked? What the fuck is this shit? What are the rules of fucking a chicken?

In a capitalistic society, you buy something, you do whatever the fuck you want with it, so if it’s legal to fuck a chicken breast under capitalism, that means you should be able to just straight up fuck a chicken, you bought that shit didn’t you?

This isn’t a conversation of fucking chicken anymore, just one of morals.

I want to live in the Parthenon with Alcibiades.

We won’t ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand next to a doric column watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body.

I’ll run behind the woods and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Alcibiades. I won’t be able to climax, and eventually I will go back the Parthenon.

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other’s eyes, and in that second, anything will be possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to whatever we were doing.

One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him next to the Parthenon. Then they’ll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.

Is the Taco Bell Sandwich Taco a sandwich or a taco?

I think this question is philosophical in the sense that its answer depends on concrete definitions of terms that derive their meanings very loosely. I have searched far and wide for answers on this subject to no avail.

To me, the answer depends on whether the distinction between sandwiches and tacos is grounded in the shape of the food item that contains the internal contents, or the constitution of the dish itself.

Here's the problem: The definition of a taco is essentially a folded tortilla containing other ingredients. The definition of a sandwich is essentially internal ingredients contained between separate pieces of bread. The Sandwich Taco transcends these definitions, as it contains internal ingredients within a folded medium, but not a tortilla. Instead, it's a folded piece of flat bread. To make it worse, the internal ingredients are more closely associated with the contents of a sandwich.

The way I see it, there are two possibilities:

The essence of a taco is that what contains the internal ingredients is a singular medium that is folded on top of itself. In this case, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a taco.

The essence of both a sandwich and a taco is grounded more so in the constitution of the medium that contains the internal ingredients and/or the internal ingredients themselves. In this case, since the external medium is flat bread, not a tortilla, and since the internal ingredients are more closely associated with a sandwich, the Sandwich Taco is clearly a sandwich.

If you're blindfolded and getting your dick sucked, you're in a superposition of it being simultaneously gay and not gay, since you don't know if it's a guy sucking your dick or a girl.

Therefore it would be logical to assume that both cases are true, and that the quantum system (you getting sucked off) is in multiple states (gay and not gay) at once: the very definition of a superposition.

The moment you remove the blindfold, this system collapses, as you are making a measurement as to whether or not a guy or a girl is sucking you off; whether or not it's gay.

This irreversibly destroys the superposition, as even if you put the blindfold back on, the uncertainty is no longer present.

I’m a huge fan of 1984, especially the writing of the characters and dialogue in it.

There was a girl I liked at school, and I tried to think of the smartest and most clever way to ask her out.

I decided to be like Winston, telling her how much I used to hate her and how I wanted to rape her and smash her head into a wall.

However, instead of being wooed like I expected, she got mad at me and told the Principal and said I was “sexually harassing” her.

It’s clear she just wasn’t intelligent enough for me and was embarrassed. However, no one wanted to hear my reasoning.

I’ve been given detention and my parents have been informed, and despite how I’m clearly in the right everyone seems to think I’m some weirdo now.

This truly is a dystopian society we live in......

Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of Attic Greek proficiency.

I am not a native speaker of philosophy's lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every Greek teacher in the Academy is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.

Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect Attic, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor Attic (Also known informally as Grammar Tyrrants) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder.

In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate eloquently in their second or third languages. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate.

To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in Attic is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.

That being said, I am aware that not all citizens of Kallipolis who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow.

However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with Attic Greek. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online.

Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via sending me a papyrus because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.

Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make: Αριστοτέλης αισχρός εστί. (Aristoteles can kiss my Athenian tushy)

When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a girl with big tits.

I (30m, Athenian) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend (50m, Athenian), let's call him Socrates, is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from other boys and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one guy in our class, let's call him "Aristotle" (20m, Macedonian), who is obsessed with my boyfriend. He goes out of his way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, he will move himself to be in the same number as him) and he recently stepped down from a the protagonistic role in a drama by Aeschylus we're doing so he could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard him say to his friends that she thinks 'Socrate''s hot and what not.

I've never said anything to him about it, because he lost his dad at a young age and seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how he disagrees with the theory of the forms and the tripartite soul) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. He also spends a lot of time writing stuff, but I really can't be bothered. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterporgy where he got slightly drunk and was bragging about how he 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and he's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until he actually went up to my boyfriend. He was a little bit drunk, and when hhe went up to him I was there too.

Aristotle started saying that he knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at him that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

He looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard he'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because he's obviously insecure and whatnot, and his friends haven't stopped calling me a Corinthian girlfriend since.

PS: He 100% knows that I am his boyfriend, I have heard him talking about me being his boyfriend before. I really hope most of whatever bullshit he writes gets lost.

Oh yeah my dick is 5 feet long actually, it's a real problem for me, I have to get really specific pants and it hinders my everyday life dramatically.

I vividly remember this one time I woke up in the middle of the night and somehow someway I actually was completely hard for the first time in my life.

However I was quickly reminded that in order for my 5 foot penis to be erect, it would mean a large portion of my blood would be redirected into the shaft of my penis.

My excitement was quickly and promptly ended when I fainted due to a lack of blood in my brain.

Now everyday I fear that this event happens in public and my massive 5 foot penis bursts through my special pants and it's promptly followed by me fainting and falling on the floor with my dick out for all to see.

Empiricism stayed with me for over a year; it was like an animal, a well-defined, spatially localizable thing.

I would wake up, open my eyes, listen—Is it here or isn't? No sign of it. Perhaps it's asleep. Perhaps it will leave me alone today. Carefully, very carefully, I get out of bed. All is quiet. I go to the kitchen, start breakfast. Not a sound. TV—Good Morning America—, David What's-his-name, a guy I can't stand. I eat and watch the guests.

Slowly the food fills my stomach and gives me strength. Now a quick excursion to the bathroom, and out for my morning walk—and here it is, my faithful empiricism asking the same fucking stupid questions: "Did you just think you could have knowledge without experience?" or "Does all knowledge degenerate into probability?"

It’s important to understand that Aristotle is not exactly well-respected in modern science or philosophy. We’re talking about a guy who believed in a geocentric solar system and the five elements of nature. He believed that women have fewer teeth than men, and that fully-formed organisms could spontaneously generate from non-living material. He believed that upward motion is superior to downward, and that forward is superior to backward. He believed the universe was perfectly spherical, and that celestial objects are continually being pushed along perfect circles around the earth. It was probably cutting-edge stuff back in the 13th century when Aquinas first encountered it, but science, philosophy, and logic have all moved on just a tad in the 800 years since.

Even the very word itself---metaphysics---has no official meaning in modern philosophy. It literally translates to “after the physics” in Greek, in that once you finish reading Aristotle’s books on the physical stuff, then apparently there’s this other collection of books you need to read after ... but P-P-PLEASE don't read any more Aristotle.

They call him "the father of logic", "the father of biology", "the father of political science", "the father of zoology", "the father of embryology", "the father of natural law", "the father of scientific method", "the father of rhetoric", "the father of psychology", "the father of realism", "the father of criticism", "the father of individualism", "the father of teleology", and "the father of meteorology".

You wanna know who he really was? The father of Nicomachus, that little prick of a baby who kept asking "What does food think when we eat it?" and "Where do you think bubbles go, oh Socrates?" when I was discussing the Forms and shit with my Athenian boys.

A German socialist philosopher was teaching a class on secularism.

"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and acknowledge the human being as the center of all things, even greater than god"

It was then that a young hegelian homeless man who had sold zero milk bottles in his union of egoist and had written over 1500 pages of egoistic critique bravely stood up and said

"Can the human being which is an abstraction truly be the center of all things, what differentiates it from god"

The arrogant professor smirked quite piously and smugly replied

"Of course you stupid egoist, human beings have projected our traits such as wisdom, love, and morality on god making us the center of all things"

"Wrong. you have merely replaced God with the abstract ideal of the human being. And what of those who do not posses these aforementioned traits, are they not a human being but rather an inhuman monster"

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of The Essence of Christianity. He stormed out of the room crying those ironically pious tears. The same tears that christians cry when you tell them morality is subjective. There was no doubt that at this point our professor, Ludwig Feuerbach wished he had formed a milk shop and become more than a liberal humanist. He wished so much to act in his own self interest, but he himself had believed that humans were omnibenevolent.

The students all applauded and embraced the creative nothing as they were unique. An Italian man named Renzo Novatore walked in and burned all the spooks.

The Unique and its property was read several times, and Wolfi Landstreicher himself showed up to present an accurate translation.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day, he had to live in a church and was forced to accept egoist critique.

That brave students name? Max Stirner.

I'm Xenophon, I am a slave boy with a weekend job at a pastry shop. My coworkers who work weekends are:

Aristocles- the owners son, we go to the Academy together, he's a friendly guy.
Ariadne  - a slave girl who works with me.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. Like how sad do you have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on a slave boy for breaking a glass.

So Aristocles and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at the shop and some guy was having a temper about how we don't serve Attic pastries properly.

So Aristocles came in and was like "Master is there a problem here?" and the man started ranting at him too. So he was just like "Xenophon, this is unacceptable, you're fired."

I started acting real sad, like "no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need to remain a slave, pleaseeee" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off chiton and leave.

The angry man started to backtrack, like "It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire him over it, some whipping will be enough. " and Aristocles was like "No, we pride ourselves on the best slaves"

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Ariadne or I, Aristocles will storm in and "fire" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.

Anyway, if you thought that was funny you should read Kant's On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives. Lying means treating another person as a means to an end and this is never justified!

So it was the Panathenaia a couple months ago. Had an orgy, got some gifts. My friend Alcibiades got for me a “super cute bikini”, I liked it, said thanks. He had ripped the tags off but whatever.

Anyway. Went to the community pool with some other philosophers. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Philosophers immediately are like uhm Socrates.... We look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru.

Haha good joke Alcibiades.

Anyway, Alcibiades invited me over to his place to hang out with him and his wife and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet his wife in the hot tub and he’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. He comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and he’s just like “oh”.

We’re in the tub for 20-30 min. Eventually get out and change. He approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a fucking see thru bathing suit Alcibiades? “He’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my wife on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from him.

Anyway, AITA?

I masturbate to pictures of Ben Shapiro almost every day just because I know he would hate the idea of a male wanking to him

it's actually really difficult because I don't find him sexually attractive in any way and especially just his headshots but I have done it every day for about 2 years because I found it funny at first but now I'm so used to it that it makes me feel incomplete if I don't do it every day.

I, an atheist, accidentally said “oh my gd” instead of “oh my science”

Am I even an atheist anymore? I don’t like religion or anything but like maybe it infiltrated me and is manipulating me to say “oh my gd” instead of “oh my science”. Please guys it wasn’t me, I didn’t mean it.

I’m very disappointed in myself, I think I need to go to science camp or go to therapy. What if I’m secretly religious? what should I do? Is my foreskin going to fall off?? Please can someone give me advice, any advice is appreciated.

Best regards,
-an atheist(?)

Literature is just poorly constructed philosophical arguments that do not rigidly follow the logical toolkit properly, that use strawman arguments to make their side look good and the other bad.

Therefore, it is just bad philosophy, and everyone should just read REAL nonfiction philosophy.

Kiddo, I have been through this rodeo time and time again.

One of the reasons that I stopped identifying as a "communist" is because I started thoroughly studying continental philosophy.

If you knew anything about the continental tradition, you would know that it operates in a way that you have to attune yourself to understanding.

You can't just slap words together and "define x," which is why philosophers like Hegel are notoriously difficult to understand.

You are only writing such nonsense to do a quick little "gotcha!" Not in good faith at all! Yikes!

But if I submit and play your little game, dialectical materialism is essentially a materialistic (in the philosophical sense) interpretation of the dialectical process.

How specific do you want me to be? Do you want me to start with Hegel's dialectic?

Are you going to quiz me some more?

My husband and I are both academics. We've been married for 3 years, and been together for 6. He is an academic philosopher and I am a physicist. He has recently expressed displeasure that I've never seriously engaged with his work. Now, I've read a bit of the classics of philosophy, but my husband's work is more in what I'm told is called the "continental" tradition. Unfortunately, everything he's shown me has just seems completely insane.

Here's the problem: his work apparently involves claims about physics that are just wrong, and wrong in a very embarrassing way! I'll admit, I'm a terrible person, but I had never read his thesis before. I tried reading it and it's riddled with talk about for instance the necessary relationship between matter having "extension" and possessing mass. He also talks about the "shape" of fundamental particles. This is obviously nonsensical/wrong; electrons have mass and are point particles (they don't take up space really). In the thesis and some other papers he wrote he seems to think of himself as "scientific" and a "materialist" but his entire idea of what these words mean is stuck in like, outdated 19th century ideas about atoms as little billiard balls flying around in space.

I've gently tried to help him and explain how he might start to engage seriously with contemporary physics (he has never read a book on the subject and is by his own admission "bad at math"), but he just gets angry with me and explains that Hegel's system is presuppositional and the basis for all possible rational thought so there is no need at all to read other texts in the first place (I have no idea what this means). He will throw out terms like "speculative propositions" but when I ask him to explain what this means or give me examples he just starts giving me more inscrutable jargon that makes no sense. On top of that, he will repeatedly say German phrases or terms that he uses (and pronounces) incorrectly (I am a native speaker) or nonsensically. He claims to understand the language (he doesn't) and tells me that Hegel can only be understood "in the original German" but he clearly can't read the language and when I've tried to read the original texts they make even less sense.

On top of this, his obsession with Hegel himself has reached the point of creepiness. At one point he literally told me that all other work either agrees with Hegel so is redundant, or disagrees with Hegel and is wrong. He keeps a framed picture of Hegel on the nightstand in our bedroom. In fact, he even changed his phone's background from a picture of me to this same picture of Hegel. I feel like I am competing with a 200 year old philosopher for my husband's attention.

Recently we got in a huge fight because he was trying to demonstrate an example of the Hegelian concept of the "unity of opposites" (whatever that means) by claiming that right and left hands are opposite but also identical. I told him this is just wrong and that right and left hands are not "identical" in any meaningful sense (chirality is a basic concept in geometry/group theory: left and right hands are not superimposable). He kept putting his hands together and tried to show how they were "identical" and kept failing (because they're not) and then got angry and stormed out of the house. I haven't seen him since (this was about a day ago) and texted him and haven't heard back.

What do I do Reddit? Do I just let this go? It's immensely frustrating that my account of my own field is not being taken seriously. He asked me to engage with his work, so I did. But it seems like he won't repay me in kind. He has told me repeatedly that Hegel makes empirical science unnecessary and implied that my work is a waste of time and that I should just be studying German idealism instead and read people like "Fichte" and "Schelling" (who are apparently very popular in Germany but I've never heard of them). Why is it okay for him to belittle my field but I can't offer mild criticism of his?

TL;DR: My husband's academic work is embarrassingly wrong and can't take any criticism.

whats that? holy shit. holy fucking shit. you fucking genius. did you actually just find out a circularity in my definition?

Did you point to a linguistic inconsistency in one of my dialogues? Did you say my conceptual analysis is flawed and leads to obscurantist metaphysics that will doom western thought for thousands of years? you fucking madlad.

i can't believe i just witnessed one of the greatest achievements in human history right now. i think im gonna cry, im so excited. to be honest, i would suck your dick to reward you for your HUGE contribution to the human race if the line wasnt so long.

you know what? fuck it. ill let you fuck Xanthippe. ill pay you lavishly in drachmas to fuck her. only for the slim chance that one of her kids will have a small part of your magnificent iq.

ill mortgage my fucking house just so you could have 15 minutes with her, while hoping that your MASSIVE cock won't rip her in half. after that, we should start a religion for you. fuck Zeus, the only thing this dick did is have sex with animals. you are entitled to the praise he's getting. we should make you immortal. losing you would mean stopping the human evolution and we would all revert to monkeys, not that we are more than monkeys in your majestic presence. I suggest we go to the agora and tell them to hand over all their authority to you, im sure you can unite all the people of Greece just with a single swing of your cock, making the entire population wet in the process.

just before that one more thing: can you shut the fuck up? nobody cares about your definitions you single chromosomed retarded gnome.

Frankly all of the last three adventuresof Tintin are wildcards in the context of the whole series. The Castafiore Emerald didn't have a proper antagonist, and we didn't see a single criminal. Tintin also didn't travel anywhere outside of the estate during the comic.

Flight 714 to Sydney had aliens.

Tintin and the Picaros is probably the most normal of the three, but damn he legit joins a militant terror group and topples a regime in a bloodless coup against a tyrannical dictator who conspired against them using planted evidence and a double agent, and then installs his friend, a recurring side character, as the de facto leader.

This, all in a bid to save Castafiore and the Dupondts. I don't think any other story is so patently wild.

I was just in my bed, jacking off and suddenly Alcibiades just opens the door and stares directly at me. He had brought some chitons and wanted to know if they were mine. I, as fast as possible, pulled away my "aa-battery", and just shouted at him "What?" (Very annoyed). He left my chitons on my chair and left the room. But before he closed the door, he winked at me.

This was all I needed to know. He knew. He knew exactly what I was doing, and I feel so embarrassed that if I were to die of a heart attack, I would thank Zeus for letting me skip tonight's orgy.
