Your silence gives consent.
Love is a serious mental disease.
I object to men having a Corinthian girlfriend or the reputed Attic pastries.
The very rich are not good.
You are even worse than a Sophist, you are -may Zeus forgive me for uttering this word- an Existentialist.
Latin is not the language of philosophy. It's not the language of science nor the language of civilization. Rome is one of the most backward empires when it comes to administration. There are five philosophy schools and they are all 100% Greek. Not a single one is Roman. Zero. Today the Koine is the language of philosophy. One day, by Zeus, it will be Attic. It used to be Attic. There is proof even in Koine books that the universal philosophy language used to be Attic. Worldwide. This will be the case once again, by Zeus. Until we reach this point we have to deal with what we have now. Right now the language of philosophy and science is Koine. 80% of all philosophical knowledge, including epistemology, is written in Koine. Only 20% is written in all the other languages together. Latin ranks in 16th place in terms of its distribution. No benefit comes from it, not in philosopy, not in science, not in building a civilization, not in administering an empire. Of course because of history and of Roman hegemony (which you would do well to be rid of!) you still have links to the Latin language. We must break through this barrier because no good comes of it. Take note of this and go study Attic. Latin is a waste of time.
