Not many know that Steve Davis, who was the president of the British Chess Federation for five years, has been a professional snooker player before and has 15 Triple Crown titles, placing him third on the all-time list.

For those who don't know, snooker is the only sport more boring than chess
---NEW---
Why checkmate you opponent when you can continue playing?
---NEW---
And here Wilhelm Steinitz, despite being an Austrian, retreats with his bishop like a French.
---NEW---
You're wrong and you should feel bad
---NEW---
We're still in theory
---NEW---
Confusing the audience
---NEW---
My opponent played bishop f8, setting up for the next game.
---NEW---
And this is the Alekhine defense, named after minster Defense
---NEW---
I once shoved a rook up my own open a-file and I liked how it felt
---NEW---
In the Smith-Morra, if two engines are playing, white probably would win 45% of games playing this. When you guys are playing, every move you make is a blunder, so it works
---NEW---
The complex stuff that Dvoretsky discusses aren't important for 99% of people, if you can call them people.

Bobby Fisher was crazy like a fox. But he was also crazy like Fox News

Not only is it checkmate, it's also a fork!

Occasionally, you guys give pieces away, for example when you're awake. Or when you're playing chess.
---NEW---
Ahhh, my favorite opening, the Caro-Kann Defence invented by Mr. Defence.
---NEW---
Je regrette, mais je forget.
---NEW---
Let's blunder, that way you guys will feel more at home.
---NEW---
You tried and you failed miserably. The lesson is: never try.
---NEW---
You're always blundering. You're not even playing right now and still blundering.
---NEW---
I'm GM Ben Finegold and you're not

You should never resign. Because if you resign, you lose.

Whenever my opponent does something, that means whatever they did makes their position not what it was.

This is my hardest chess related question: which city is worse, Berlin or London? London is really expensive and the weather is terrible, that's what they got. Also, there's British people there. Indian food used to be good, now it's better here.

If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question 'What was Wittgenstein's biggest contribution to philosophy', I should answer 'His asking of the question "Can one play chess without the Queen?"'.

My best student ever, for a short period of time, was a friend of mine who is autistic - this is basically everybody. He has a PhD in Math, so not stupid. And he's rated 2000. He was rated 1800 for five years. I taught him chess and in two months he was rated over 2000.  And the reason is, he's autistic. So, I taught him something, he did it because he had to. You guys will be like "I'm not doing that".

Frankly, Hikaru is a historically great chess player famous for how gracious he is in victory and defeat. He is also adored by women and is the only one capable of challenging Magnus.
---NEW---
So, when I was a little kid and went to the church, I was really happy when the bishop was gone
---NEW---
Grandmaster "Ben" Finegold is the only chess stand-upper in the world, and he does it while standing down.
---NEW---
So, I went to a Lakers game and shouted De-Fe-Nce and Lebron answered "what fence?".
---NEW---
The fact that Hikaru has the patience to play with kids in a respectful and kind way proves beyond any reasonable doubt that he is the greatest human being (and chess player) of all times. But what I admire the most is his infinite modesty, other players (Finegold I'm looking at you) have a lot learn here.
---NEW---
Tal occasionally smoked. Like when he was awake.

I belong to pawn grabbers anonymous

At this point black didn't actually resign, the arbiter said 'Ok, that's enough'

Michael J. Kummer is teaching children for goodness' sake. He listens to every comment. He takes every comment seriously and knows when to respond and when to ignore and push on with the game. He's got bags of personality and he knows more than his typical audience which makes him a great educator.

He's got his own catchphrases ('Knight UP') and he's taking chess to a much wider audience than a GM droning on about his analysis of some obscure variation. So, stop it with the intellectual masturbation.

Interviewer: Well, yes, but let's not get ahead of ourselves...

Interviewer: Why?
Me: Because it's explosive

Didn't get the job. Terrible.

Theres a very unsportsmanlike player at our chess club who constantly taunts and belittles everyone else. Whenever you make a mistake he yells out "blunder!" or "inaccuracy!" ... "better move was..." and then says the engine move or what he thinks the engine move is. He also says what he thinks the engine +- is. He plays the Smith-Morra gambit as much as he can and knows like 30 moves deep into every variation. If you respond something other than c5xd4 to 1.e4 c5 2. d4 he just laughs and calls you a patzer.

He's also OBSESSED with Anatoly Karpov. He talks about him all the time and shows everyone a picture of him with Karpov (it's really blurry so its hard to tell if its even him). He's constantly talking about him as if he's a close friend even though he only (maybe?) met him one time. Its bordering on creepy and makes everyone uncomfortable. He calls him "Gaspadin Karpov" which I think is part of his obsession with Russian culture. He also brings Russian vodka and pelmeni to the club every day and will spend like 5-10 minute drinking during his turn just to taunt you. Meanwhile he will be mumbling words in Russian.

We tried approaching about his conduct but he just did some weird Soviet poster laugh, yelled something in Russian, then ran off to challenge another person to a blitz match. We obviously don't want to tell him not to come but it feels like his presence is deterring new people from joining and its also exhausting.
